          In this Responsive Web Design Certification, you'll learn the
          languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext
          Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for
          design.
        </div>
        <div className="flex text-xl mb-5">
          First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and
          CSS. Later, you'll learn modern techniques like CSS variables by
          building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a
          quiz site.

AJAX refers to a group of technologies that make asynchronous requests to a server to transfer data, then load any returned data into the page. And the data transferred between the browser and server is often in a format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)."
